# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: Its statements that has programs run programs depending on true/false or if /else if.

Researched answer:  "It tells a program to execute an action depending on whether a condition is true or false. It is often represented as an if-then or if-then-else statement"

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git tracks any changes in computer files/codes. Github is a platform to upload and download repos. 

Researched answer: "Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development". GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository."

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: "||"

Researched answer: The logical OR ( || ) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a location of a value. The difference between the two is that index counts the location of the value and the value is a data type that contains an element.

Researched answer: " Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element." "The content of each element is called the value."

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are typicaly variables that store data in an ordered list. Strings are usually collections of characters wrapped in quotation marks. The way that they are different is that an Array is a collection of data whilst string is not.One way that they are similasr is that they both store data and use ""

Researched answer: "Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character."

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The driver will be the one who shairs their screen and codes whilst the navigator tells how to code the problem .

Researched answer: "Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. "
